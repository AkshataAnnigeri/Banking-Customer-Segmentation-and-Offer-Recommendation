#Banking-Customer-Segmentation-and-Offer-Recommendation

This project focused on improving how a bank recommends financial offers by moving away from a static, one-size-fits-all approach to a more dynamic, behavior-driven strategy. I started by analyzing internal transaction data to segment customers based on real-world behavior such as product usage, payment history, and overall engagement rather than just income or tenure. I redefined loyalty using a custom scoring system that combined key behavioral metrics, and applied KMeans clustering to validate the groupings. One of the most surprising findings was that 64% percent of customers labeled as loyal had already churned. This revealed a major gap in the bank’s current recommendation logic. To address this, I created a rule-based offer system that considered churn risk, income level, and behavioral profiles. Premium offers were sent only to high-value, engaged customers, while strategic retention offers were targeted at those showing signs of disengagement. Compared to the bank’s original method, my solution offered more precise targeting and a better fit with customer needs, ultimately helping to reduce churn and improve long-term engagement.
